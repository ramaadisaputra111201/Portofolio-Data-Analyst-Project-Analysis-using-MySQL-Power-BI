# Portofolio-Data-Analyst-Project-Analysis-using-MySQL-Power-BI

In this project, I built an analytical view called project_analysis using SQL to integrate project, employee, and department data from multiple tables into a comprehensive dataset. The process began with the creation of a Common Table Expression (CTE) named project_status, which combined data from the upcoming projects and completed projects tables using UNION ALL, while adding a status column to indicate each projectâ€™s stage. Next, the data was joined with the employees, departments, and project_assignments tables through several JOIN operations to produce a complete view containing employee information, job titles, salaries, department budgets, and project statuses (ongoing or completed). The final result was stored as a view that can be used to analyze project performance, human resource allocation, and budget efficiency.
